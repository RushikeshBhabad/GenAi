Laboratory \\nInstructors may design suitable set of assignments for respective course at their level. Beyond \\ncurriculum assignments and mini-project may be included as a part of laboratory work. The \\ninstructor may set multiple sets of assignments and distribute among batches of students. It is \\nappreciated if the assignments are based on real world problems/applications. The Inclusion of \\nfew optional assignments that are intricate and/or beyond the scope of curriculum will surely be \\nthe value addition for the students and it will satisfy the intellectuals within the group of the \\nlearners and will add to the perspective of the learners. For each laboratory assignment, it is \\nessential for students to draw/write/generate flowchart, algorithm, test cases, mathematical model, \\nTest data set and comparative/complexity analysis (as applicable). Batch size for practical and \\ntutorial may be as per guidelines of authority.  \\n\\uf0b7 Term Work–Term work is continuous assessment that evaluates a student's progress throughout \\nthe semester. Term work assessment criteria specify the standards that must be met and the \\nevidence that will be gathered to demonstrate the achievement of course outcomes. Categorical \\nassessment criteria for the term work should establish unambiguous standards of achievement \\nfor each course outcome. They should describe what the learner is expected to perform in the \\nlaboratories or on the fields to show that the course outcomes have been achieved.  It is \\nrecommended to conduct internal monthly practical examination as part of continuous \\nassessment. \\n\\uf0b7 Assessment: Students’ work will be evaluated typically based on the criteria like attentiveness, \\nproficiency in execution of the task, regularity, punctuality, use of referencing, accuracy of \\nlanguage, use of supporting evidence in drawing conclusions, quality of critical thinking and \\nsimilar performance measuring criteria.  \\n\\uf0b7 Laboratory Journal- Program codes with sample output of all performed assignments are to be \\nsubmitted as softcopy. Use of DVD or similar media containing students programs maintained by \\nLaboratory In-charge is highly encouraged. For reference one or two journals may be maintained \\nwith program prints in the Laboratory. As a conscious effort and little contribution towards Green \\nIT and environment awareness, attaching printed papers as part of write-ups and program listing \\nto journal may be avoided. Submission of journal/ term work in the form of softcopy is desirable \\nand appreciated. \\nSuggested List of Assignments \\nSr. No \\nName of assignment \\n1 \\nAccess an open source dataset “Titanic”.  \\nApply pre-processing techniques on the raw dataset. \\n2 \\nBuild training and testing dataset of assignment 1 to predict the probability of a survival of a \\nperson based on gender, age and passenger-class. \\n3 \\nDownload Abalone dataset.

Laboratory \\nInstructors may design suitable set of assignments for respective course at their level. Beyond \\ncurriculum assignments and mini-project may be included as a part of laboratory work. The \\ninstructor may set multiple sets of assignments and distribute among batches of students. It is \\nappreciated if the assignments are based on real world problems/applications. The Inclusion of \\nfew optional assignments that are intricate and/or beyond the scope of curriculum will surely be \\nthe value addition for the students and it will satisfy the intellectuals within the group of the \\nlearners and will add to the perspective of the learners. For each laboratory assignment, it is \\nessential for students to draw/write/generate flowchart, algorithm, test cases, mathematical model, \\nTest data set and comparative/complexity analysis (as applicable). Batch size for practical and \\ntutorial may be as per guidelines of authority.  \\n\\uf0b7 Term Work–Term work is continuous assessment that evaluates a student's progress throughout \\nthe semester. Term work assessment criteria specify the standards that must be met and the \\nevidence that will be gathered to demonstrate the achievement of course outcomes. Categorical \\nassessment criteria for the term work should establish unambiguous standards of achievement \\nfor each course outcome. They should describe what the learner is expected to perform in the \\nlaboratories or on the fields to show that the course outcomes have been achieved.  It is \\nrecommended to conduct internal monthly practical examination as part of continuous \\nassessment. \\n\\uf0b7 Assessment: Students’ work will be evaluated typically based on the criteria like attentiveness, \\nproficiency in execution of the task, regularity, punctuality, use of referencing, accuracy of \\nlanguage, use of supporting evidence in drawing conclusions, quality of critical thinking and \\nsimilar performance measuring criteria.  \\n\\uf0b7 Laboratory Journal- Program codes with sample output of all performed assignments are to be \\nsubmitted as softcopy. Use of DVD or similar media containing students programs maintained by \\nLaboratory In-charge is highly encouraged. For reference one or two journals may be maintained \\nwith program prints in the Laboratory. As a conscious effort and little contribution towards Green \\nIT and environment awareness, attaching printed papers as part of write-ups and program listing \\nto journal may be avoided. Submission of journal/ term work in the form of softcopy is desirable \\nand appreciated. \\nSuggested List of Assignments \\nSr. No \\nName of assignment \\n1 \\nCreating & Visualizing Neural Network for the given data.
